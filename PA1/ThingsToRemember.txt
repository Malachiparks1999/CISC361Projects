				Then will remove accordingly
	
3. Print Linked List forwards and backwards (done)

	2. Adding deleteItems declaration --- Done

When deleting --- should not exit when entering wrong information
deleting middle node + end node (Does while loop ever iterate?) + multiple deletes
printing backwards ---> Make print print useful information + Printing prompt
free memory?
Make adding print nicely of whats being added in main.c
Make main.c prompt for name to be passed in so deletion occurs
